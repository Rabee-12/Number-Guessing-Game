# Number-Guessing-Game
A simple Python game to guess numbers between 1 and 31.

A Python game that guesses the number you're thinking of (between 1 and 31).

## How It Works
1. Think of a number between 1 and 31.
2. The program will display lists of numbers and ask if your number is in each list.
3. Type `y` for yes or `n` for no.
4. The program calculates and displays your number.

## Example
if your number that you are thinking of is here type [y,n] ['1', '2', '5', '7', '9', '11', '13', '15', '17', '19', '21', '23', '25', '27', '29', '31'] y ... your number is: 17
